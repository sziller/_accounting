Accounting software for private purposes.
Root repo here, on Github as software is developed under open source copyright.

I recommend storing user data in a private repository. My invoice data is not public, I will however provide some
examples enabling easy tests, tutorials and rehersal use.

[WARNING]
====
I do not take any responsibility for errors originating in using my software, or the information implied from it.
There are hardcoded and file stored accounting rulez here that are not verified by any professional accountant.
DO NOT TAKE ANYTHING ON FACE VALUE, check your legal duties based on your usecase and/or jurisdiction.
